## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management
Please make sure you have downloaded JAVAFX jar files.

Select the one use for your OS.

after that you can clone the repo, then add it those .jar files to the project

if you use VSCODE make sure you go to RUN -> Add Configuration

in Launch.json

make sure you add the "vmArgs": "--module-path \" the path to the javafx lib directory\" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml"
